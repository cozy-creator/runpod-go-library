### Essential Go Commands

Run these commands to check for and correct errors in the library:

```bash
go fmt ./...   # Formats code to the standard Go style
go vet ./...   # Static analysis; flags subtle issues beyond syntax
go build ./... # Compiles all packages; ensures everything type-checks
```
